# Finance Prediction â€“ Time Series

This repository provides a modular **time-series forecasting system** for financial assets such as stocks, REITs, and bonds.  
The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering with technical indicators, and several forecasting models for multi-horizon price prediction.

## Project Purpose

The project aims to explore and evaluate various forecasting models on financial time-series data using both raw price data and engineered technical indicators.

Key features:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for technical indicators  
- Forecasting asset prices using multiple models including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)  
- Multi-horizon forecasting for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days ahead  
- Model evaluation with train-test splits and one-day-ahead prediction  
- Portfolio optimization based on predicted prices (using genetic algorithm)  
- Visualization of results and performance metrics  
- Telegram bot integration for sending notifications and updates about predictions

## Telegram Bot Integration

The project includes a Telegram bot (`app/telegram_bot.py`) that enables users to receive notifications and interact with the forecasting system through Telegram.  
Features include:

- Sending forecast results and alerts directly to users via Telegram messages  
- Simple command interface for querying model predictions  
- Easy setup using Telegram Bot API token stored securely via environment variables
